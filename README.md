# Bitcoin-Hub
An ongoing project that will contain all necessary tools to interact with the bitcoin network.  This project is purely intended to extend my knowledge about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, as well as provide a reference implementation for each of the tools it contains. The core functionality will be entirely written in python and will consequently be terribly slow.

## Tools it contains
This is a work in progress, so here is a rough outline of the final project
- A Bitcoin private key/public key/address generator
	- This is almost complete, I just need to add support for BIP-38 (Passphrase encryption), P2SH and Multisignature addresses.  I will revisit these after I develop the Wallet
	- I also need to fix up the documentation where necessary
- Bitcoin Wallet (TODO)
	- Current tool I'm working on at the moment.
- Bitcoin Miner (TODO)
- Transaction Explorer (Not sure about this one since the user may have to run a full node to get this functionality)

## Features I may include
- Coloured coins support
- Segwit support

## Frontend Design
It will take me a while to get to this stage since I am working on this in my spare time.  I want to  use Electron and CSS, JS, HTML to develop a visually appealling frontend and improve my web design skills.
